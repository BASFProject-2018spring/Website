                            The organic food industry has been growing rapidly over the past few years. An important task in the organic food industry is to find alternatives to chemical pesticides for protecting crops and plants from pests due to the detrimental consequences of pesticides. An alternative to chemical pesticides is
                            to
                            encourage naturally occurring organisms in the soil to destroy pests such as slugs, weevils
                            and
                            caterpillars. Nematodes are naturally occurring microscopic worms already present in the
                            soil
                            that
                            actively seek out and destroy pests. Biologicals for pest control is one of the focus areas
                            within
                            BASF's Agricultural Solutions business. They develop unique formulations of beneficial
                            nematodes
                            and
                            their storage media to provide optimum stability and product performance. The nematodes in
                            the
                            products selectively target problematic insect species, while remaining harmless to
                            beneficial
                            insects (e.g. ladybugs) and nearby wildlife. Finding an efficient way to use nematodes to
                            protect
                            crops could potentially reduce the need to introduce artificial chemicals in to the food
                            supply. BASF is the only mass producer of nematodes used for slug protection, utilizing a plant in
                            Littlehampton, UK equipped with 20 vessels that provide over 190,000 L of fermentation
                            capacity
                            and
                            can hold ~ 38 Ã— 10<sup>12</sup> nematodes. Product quality is continually tested and
                            maintained
                            through
                            refrigeration and efficient shipping logistics to all their customers, which is a key BASF
                            skill.

                            As shown in the figure above, nematodes have different efficacy at different stages of their life cycles. Automation of
                            identification of whether a nematode is infective juvenile or not enables efficient quality
                            control. This
                            project
                            applied deep learning techniques to microscope image data of nematode populations to
                            determine
                            whether nematodes are at infective juvenile stage <b>(interested)</b> or not <b>(non-interested)</b>.
                            We implemented and trained a scale-aware (SA) version of
                            faster
                            region-based convolutional neural network (faster R-CNN) model for the identification and
                            classification of nematodes from microscope images, and built a software package in a
                            virtual machine image for the automation of nematode classification task.

                            BASF didn't have a digital way to label the nematodes in the microscope images. Initially,
                            we only had some sample microscope images and a slide briefing the characteristics of each
                            life stage of nematodes. A sample image is shown below.

                            We implemented a labeling tool and delivered it to BASF. BASF used the labeling tool we
                            provided to generate digitalized labels of nematodes in microscope images.</p>

                            Typically, we need much more samples to train a deep neural network such as faster R-CNN.
                            Considering we don't have enough data, we have applied aggressive data augmentation.
                            For each original image, we generate its flipped versions and illumination adjusted

                            Conventional computer vision methods rely on the extraction of feature vectors from images
                            or image patches by using the feature descriptor. Histogram of oriented gradients
                            (HOG) is a popular feature descriptor, which uses the distribution of directions of
                            gradients as
                            features
                            [<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1467360/">1</a>].
                            Gradients of an image are large around edges and corners, which carry a lot of information
                            about object
                            shape, and are thus useful for classification. The HOG descriptors can be fed into a
                            conventional classification algorithm, such as support vector machine (SVM).

                            Deep learning methods usually outperform conventional methods when there are enough data.
                            Faster
                            R-CNN
                            is the state-of-the-art deep learning algorithm for object detection [<a
                                href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.01497">2</a>]. The basic idea is
                            first
                            apply convolutional layers to get the feature maps. The region proposal network (RPN)
                            then takes different
                            sizes and positions of anchor boxes from the feature map, and learns to classify bounding
                            boxes
                            into
                            background and foreground as well as to refine the bounding boxes. The foreground
                            boxes from
                            RPN
                            goes
                            through region of interest pooling. It will resize the feature map corresponding to the
                            proposed bounding boxes into same
                            shape, and the classifier will predict the class of each bounding box.

                            From a machine learning point of view, the problem could be divided into two parts:
                            detection and classification. Detection is to find individual nematodes in the
                            microscope image. Classification is to predict whether each nematode is in interested stage.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The steps of our baseline model is as follows:
                        </p>

                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                Extract images of individual nematodes from a microscope image. Our segmentation uses
                                conventional computer vision techniques. We set area threshold and average color
                                threshold to distinguish large noise contours from nematodes.
                            </li>
                            <li>

                                Apply classification on the feature vectors. The classifier could be anything like
                                support vector machine or
                                random forest.

                        <p>
                            Our baseline models can not handle situations such as overlapped nematodes. They also seem
                            unable to capture details which could be very important in classification.
                            Deep learning models usually outperform conventional methods when there are enough data. We
                            applied an end-to-end faster R-CNN model for nematode detection and classification.
                        </p>

                        <p>

                            We applied a pre-trained RES-152 [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385">3</a>] network
                            to get the feature maps. The region proposal network
                            (RPN) takes different sizes and positions of anchor boxes from the feature map, and learns
                            to classify bounding boxes into background and foreground; it also learns to refine the
                            bounding boxes. The output of RPN goes through region of interest (RoI) pooling. It resizes
                            the feature map corresponding to the proposed bounding boxes into same shape, and the
                            classifier will predict the class of
                            each bounding box.

                        <p>
                            The sizes of bounding boxes are not explicitly considered when faster R-CNN does
                            classification, since RoI layer resizes feature maps into same dimensions. This makes sense
                            in most applications
                            because objects appear smaller when they are further away. When we do object detection in
                            such cases, size of bounding boxes (or feature maps) shouldnâ€™t be considered.

                            However, in microscope images, the distance to camera is fixed. And when we classify
                            nematodes, size matters. Nematodes that are either too small or too big are unlikely to be
                            interested. To take the size information into account, we implemented a modified version of
                            faster R-CNN, which we call scale-aware R-CNN (SA-R-CNN). We get the size information from
                            RPN, which is then passed into the classifier together with the results from RoI pooling.

                        From the results, we see our SA-R-CNN is better than the default faster R-CNN and both of them
                        are
                        better than conventional models (since conventional models are worse on detection, the
                        statistics
                        shown for conventional models are higher than the actual values). For detection, our SA-R-CNN
                        predicts many nematode-like objects such as dead nematodes. However, since almost all those
                        predictions are non-interested, we think itâ€™s not an issue (dead nematodes are not interested
                        anyway).

                        As discussed, we think our models are not trained enough due to the lack of training data. With
                        more
                        data, we believe our models can do better.

                    <p>In the latest meeting, BASF told us they would like to add more classes of nematodes in the
                        future (such as dead nematode class). So we have included information on places to change for
                        our model working for more classes. This documentation is also in our training pipeline.</p>

                    <p>Once BASF have new data labled (with more classes), they could make changes to our code
                        accordingly and train a new model.</p>

                    <p>
                        BASF is also interested in how the model makes the prediction (i.e. what features the network
                        learns). However, deep learning models are hard to interpret.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One way to do this is to fit a simpler model to simulate the deep learning model, using the
                        desired features (like size, angle and etc.). The fitted simpler model can partially explain the
                        deep neural network. The problem is that some desired features are hard to define mathematically
                        (for example, the angle or the shape) and some features are hard to extract (for example,
                        accurately obtaining size of a nematode is hard). We leave this method as a future work.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Another simpler empirical way is to get an interested nematode, change its features and see
                        whether our model changes the prediction. We did this method and the result is shown in the
                        following images.

                    <p>
                        We made the first image based on an interested nematode (top-left corner). We used PhotoShop to
                        rotate the nematode, change its color, resize it and change its shape. All generated fake
                        nematodes were then combined into a single image whose background is from a training image. The
                        second image is generated by passing the first image into our model. We observed the following:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            The model predicts all rotated nematodes as interested. So rotation doesn't affect the
                            model.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            With mild shape change, the nematodes are still predicted as interested. However, if we
                            straighten the nematode, it will become non-interested. So the model does look at the shape
                            of the nematode, but with mild shape change, its prediction won't change.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Relative darkness (brightness) of nematodes matters a lot. We changed the brightness of the
                            nematode and it becomes non-intersted. For more aggressive change (let the nematode
                            transparent), our model will think the nematode is part of the background.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Size matters a lot. Letting the nematode larger or smaller makes it non-interested. If the
                            nematode is too small, our model will think it's part of the background.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Noise does not matter. There're different debris around the rotated nematodes and the
                            original nematodes. But the model does not change the prediction nor the prediction
                            confidence level.
                        </li>

                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        We conducted such experiment on some nematodes and the conclusions are similar. So we hope our
                        conclusions above is generalizable for all nematode images because that means our model works as
                        expected. In order to get insight about how exactly the model uses those features to make
                        decisions, we need to use more sophisticated methods.

                        We have implemented both conventional models and deep learning models for the
                        nematode detection and classification tasks. We have created a new network
                        architecture to make faster R-CNN model scale aware for nematode classification. Our deep
                        learning
                        models outperform baseline models, although our models suffer from overfitting due to the
                        unavailability of enough training data. Also, we have delivered our models and GUI (with tools
                        like CSV generator) within a virtual machine to BASF.

                            Currently our models assume the input images are at a fixed scale. For different scale
                            images, users have to use <a
